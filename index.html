    <h2>ðŸ‘¾ About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Trinket Software is a small independent games company with a fierce passion for great indie games at what we believe is a fair price. We don't have costs like an office to recoup, so we don't have anything huge to pass on to you, the player.<br><br>As a remote-first games company, we believe that developers work best when they're in an environment that they enjoy. We also believe strongly in, and enforce, a four-day work week and a relaxed 10:00 - 5:30 daily schedule so that our people can enjoy their mornings a little longer. Our developers value their time both in and out of work, and under no circumstances do we interrupt our employees outside of work, but if we're all close together, we might hang out in a nice village pub or a museum for a day out. No work stress, just friends.<br><br>We're currently working on our first title which is (hopefully) soon to be announced.
